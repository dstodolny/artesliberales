    <h2>What This Is</h2>
    <p>This site is an open restoration of the <strong>liberal arts curriculum</strong> as it was practiced in the Jesuit colleges of early modern Europe. We begin with the foundation: <em>Grammatica</em>—the systematic mastery of Latin and Greek through reading, memorisation, imitation, and composition. All materials are public domain or sourced from original Latin works.</p>

    <p>We are not recreating school. We are restoring a <strong>curriculum of civilisation</strong>: a canon of formation, studied at home or in small communities, with books and practices that shaped the minds of saints, scientists, statesmen, and scholars for centuries.</p>

    <p><strong>Open Source & Public Domain:</strong> All resources are either public domain or open source. Suggestions and contributions are welcome—visit the project on <a href="https://github.com/dstodolny/artesliberales">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>Phase I Focus: <em>Grammatica</em></h2>
    <p>We are now building the resources, exercises, and original Latin texts to restore this first and most essential phase of education. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily Latin drills and paradigms from Alvarez's Grammar (<em>Institutiones Grammaticae</em>).</li>
      <li>Graded reading plans (Cicero, Ovid, Virgil).</li>
      <li>Latin-only flashcards and memory work.</li>
      <li>Tools for prelection, repetition, and retroversion (vernacular to Latin).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is the entry point to the <em>Artes Liberales</em>. Nothing proceeds without <em>Grammatica</em>.</p>
